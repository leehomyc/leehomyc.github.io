Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.18217.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"68fbafe8677904dd08bc9970","avatarUrl":"/avatars/1cf6ed148a5bac8df423f2f81277610d.svg","fullname":"Lin G","name":"lgmeta","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"66b54027408752ae16404b05","name":"metaresearch","fullname":"Meta Research","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/66b25f3f58babfaeb76112dc/2GmiaF075AZ7BcE538oPk.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.17761","authors":[{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df0","name":"Dongjie Cheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df1","name":"Ruifeng Yuan","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df2","name":"Yongqi Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df3","name":"Runyang You","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df4","name":"Wenjie Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df5","name":"Liqiang Nie","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df6","name":"Lei Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69782b0b026bdf0473116df7","name":"Wenjie Li","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-25T09:17:36.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-27T00:44:18.506Z","title":"AR-Omni: A Unified Autoregressive Model for Any-to-Any Generation","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64ac01f8ac13891808807e01","avatarUrl":"/avatars/25a2e2ad943581521ad488d00bf37738.svg","isPro":true,"fullname":"charlie","user":"charlesdj","type":"user"},"summary":"Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of \"Omni\" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs.

Additional experiments show that agents trained on our data can adapt from fixed-corpus retrieval to Google Search at inference time, without further training.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.18202.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","fullname":"taesiri","name":"taesiri","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":218,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"5e6aca39878b8b2bf9806447","name":"google","fullname":"Google","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/5dd96eb166059660ed1ee413/WtA3YYitedOr9n02eHfJe.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.17323","authors":[{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f0c","user":{"_id":"65dc3a850af7e21ba40e939f","avatarUrl":"/avatars/e129c64617675edd05d4317d39604318.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Li","user":"Debang","type":"user"},"name":"Debang Li","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:35:19.214Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f0d","user":{"_id":"617ba1820e4237bd1731b867","avatarUrl":"/avatars/f9de06363e64bddd7dc977e96e85df8a.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"zhengcong fei","user":"onion","type":"user"},"name":"Zhengcong Fei","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:35:27.008Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f0e","user":{"_id":"643bedaf9f5d314db2da178d","avatarUrl":"/avatars/a166dd66586f3600d95b725de6350bc1.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"tuanhuili","user":"tuanhui","type":"user"},"name":"Tuanhui Li","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:35:34.618Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f0f","name":"Yikun Dou","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f10","name":"Zheng Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f11","user":{"_id":"665402169ccb17d9678be0d2","avatarUrl":"/avatars/9142d09c8d0e866eb688002d50fd3cbe.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jiangping Yang","user":"JumpingXL","type":"user"},"name":"Jiangping Yang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:35:53.130Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f12","name":"Mingyuan Fan","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f13","name":"Jingtao Xu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f14","name":"Jiahua Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f15","name":"Baoxuan Gu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f16","user":{"_id":"65ab6d073e7c8dcbbeeeede8","avatarUrl":"/avatars/fab2af24c653019665f1f8120fc3273b.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Mingshan Chang","user":"shesshan","type":"user"},"name":"Mingshan Chang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:36:18.951Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f17","name":"Yuqiang Xie","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f18","name":"Binjie Mao","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f19","name":"Youqiang Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f1a","name":"Nuo Pang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f1b","name":"Hao Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f1c","name":"Yuzhe Jin","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f1d","user":{"_id":"65a932d909480af928b47b4c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/2050dd33da157c12adc8f598175f4cd8.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Zhiheng Xu","user":"Zonnes","type":"user"},"name":"Zhiheng Xu","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:36:53.072Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f1e","name":"Dixuan Lin","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f1f","user":{"_id":"6909e8b1d8dc3e811139c1da","avatarUrl":"/avatars/30b14c15331ed6613456c9b3b4110e1b.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Guibin Chen","user":"jlu-cgb","type":"user"},"name":"Guibin Chen","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:37:01.680Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69783b4b026bdf0473116f20","name":"Yahui Zhou","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-24T06:08:12.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-27T01:43:04.419Z","title":"SkyReels-V3 Technique Report","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","isPro":true,"fullname":"taesiri","user":"taesiri","type":"user"},"summary":"Video generation serves as a cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability.

Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench.

Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains.

Using only 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.13599.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"65e52e7d27dc8aa470a640e3","avatarUrl":"/avatars/022a179d14de29b9ab9d96fcc85aa264.svg","fullname":"hankai","name":"hankaixyz","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"5f83c275f0801648bf88454a","name":"huawei-noah","fullname":"HUAWEI Noah's Ark Lab","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1602470452594-5f83c19ff0801648bf884549.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.18759","authors":[{"_id":"69784102026bdf0473116f34","name":"Junling Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69784102026bdf0473116f35","user":{"_id":"67ec110027088e548d5f3cb1","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5a26a99b214877035528ab0d33febed4.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Hongyi Lan","user":"HenryLhy","type":"user"},"name":"Hongyi Lan","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-27T14:41:41.357Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69784102026bdf0473116f36","name":"Xiaotian Su","hidden":false},{"_id":"69784102026bdf0473116f37","name":"Mustafa Doga Dogan","hidden":false},{"_id":"69784102026bdf0473116f38","name":"April Yi Wang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-26T18:26:49.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-27T02:07:37.986Z","title":"UI Remix: Supporting UI Design Through Interactive Example Retrieval and Remixing","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","isPro":true,"fullname":"taesiri","user":"taesiri","type":"user"},"summary":"Designing user interfaces (UIs) is a critical step when launching products, building portfolios, or personalizing projects, yet end users without design expertise often struggle to articulate their intent and to trust design choices.

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored.

Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces.
