We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8times (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.18692.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64252045a4f3051f54dd1d53","avatarUrl":"/avatars/0e423a3291091be3b4736a14da3ce495.svg","fullname":"kecheng zheng","name":"zkcys001","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"69709f892cd08371c1011a2e","name":"robbyant","fullname":"Robbyant","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/67aeffda7330db26f93cd62f/ZTuImney4XzRmBHyUL47F.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.19834","authors":[{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4761","user":{"_id":"643b866bff50448bcfc7d1d1","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/noauth/q12v-BatVKimoi8q-coi-.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jialong Wu","user":"manchery","type":"user"},"name":"Jialong Wu","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-28T11:16:37.217Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4762","name":"Xiaoying Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4763","name":"Hongyi Yuan","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4764","name":"Xiangcheng Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4765","name":"Tianhao Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4766","name":"Changjing He","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4767","name":"Chaoyi Deng","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4768","name":"Renrui Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e4769","name":"Youbin Wu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69797e24df44b75fa47e476a","name":"Mingsheng Long","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-27T17:40:07.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-28T00:46:44.173Z","title":"Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"643b866bff50448bcfc7d1d1","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/noauth/q12v-BatVKimoi8q-coi-.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jialong Wu","user":"manchery","type":"user"},"summary":"Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models.

By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.19798.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"610a70f35a40a8bfebfbf09b","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1659922312540-610a70f35a40a8bfebfbf09b.jpeg","fullname":"Daniel Bourke","name":"mrdbourke","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":192,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"66543b6e420092799d2f625c","name":"tencent","fullname":"Tencent","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/5dd96eb166059660ed1ee413/Lp3m-XLpjQGwBItlvn69q.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.09150","authors":[{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4831","name":"Jianwen Sun","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4832","name":"Yukang Feng","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4833","name":"Kaining Ying","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4834","name":"Chuanhao Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4835","name":"Zizhen Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4836","name":"Fanrui Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4837","name":"Jiaxin Ai","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4838","name":"Yifan Chang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e4839","name":"Yu Dai","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e483a","name":"Yifei Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6979a32cdf44b75fa47e483b","name":"Kaipeng Zhang","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/65f1713552c38a91e0a445e8/dWe8NkE2o-SBkMqd897MA.mp4"],"publishedAt":"2026-01-14T04:45:05.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-28T03:30:08.387Z","title":"World Craft: Agentic Framework to Create Visualizable Worlds via Text","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"65f1713552c38a91e0a445e8","avatarUrl":"/avatars/47ab3ada51c9b9976ac1cd0c4301c373.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"kaipeng","user":"kpzhang996","type":"user"},"summary":"Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate generative agent simulation (e.g., AI Town) to create a ``dynamic world'', holding immense value across entertainment and research.

Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset (n{=}4181) and a tagged, non-standard subset (n{=}247). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in 96.4% of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models.

Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset (n{=}4181) and a tagged, non-standard subset (n{=}247). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in 96.4% of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs.
