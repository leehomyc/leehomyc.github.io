Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6697765937d24838267b41e7/309vLCCbUoiHGJkN0u3LH.mp4"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.14250.png","numComments":4,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6697765937d24838267b41e7","avatarUrl":"/avatars/682bb4cf0a0009812b42748dc26916f9.svg","fullname":"PangzeCheung","name":"PangzeCheung","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"653b817d32c97d0655575872","name":"ByteDance","fullname":"ByteDance","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6535c9e88bde2fae19b6fb25/0clr54wj5Ly-RkYU9OXPp.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.14192","authors":[{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af3a","user":{"_id":"6745c589d2d740914ec2574f","avatarUrl":"/avatars/7b2ff6848d42cd140a775df0c2bc9384.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Xiaofang Yang","user":"fffovo","type":"user"},"name":"Xiaofang Yang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-21T10:48:39.583Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af3b","name":"Lijun Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af3c","user":{"_id":"660d17d6c9be0dcd31a30b3d","avatarUrl":"/avatars/3743fe9b695c488ebe33f0d8fd607a8a.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Zhou Heng","user":"henggg","type":"user"},"name":"Heng Zhou","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-21T09:19:49.600Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af3d","name":"Tong Zhu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af3e","name":"Xiaoye Qu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af3f","name":"Yuchen Fan","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af40","user":{"_id":"6952244bfbddb08cb2562f3b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/70d67319af29604129378fee3f216757.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"qianshan wei","user":"b1intern","type":"user"},"name":"Qianshan Wei","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-21T10:49:04.253Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af41","name":"Rui Ye","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af42","name":"Li Kang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af43","name":"Yiran Qin","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af44","name":"Zhiqiang Kou","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af45","name":"Daizong Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af46","name":"Qi Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af47","name":"Ning Ding","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af48","user":{"_id":"65257545b017be1fc1915364","avatarUrl":"/avatars/9bffd3fb567d2fa1e5c3546d77560b43.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Siheng Chen","user":"sihengchen","type":"user"},"name":"Siheng Chen","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-21T10:49:26.261Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69705a68a8be625b19c2af49","name":"Jing Shao","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-20T17:51:56.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-21T02:28:39.429Z","title":"Toward Efficient Agents: Memory, Tool learning, and Planning","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"641d3efac3983aa9491677b9","avatarUrl":"/avatars/53565486351c16a1ac8ea863963e2d9b.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Lijun Li","user":"adwardlee","type":"user"},"summary":"Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in extending large language models into agentic systems.

Therefore, leveraging reward models (RMs) to automatically and reliably evaluate memory quality is critical. In this work, we introduce MemoryRewardBench, the first benchmark to systematically study the ability of RMs to evaluate long-term memory management processes.

Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable.

We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.14249.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"655c6b1abfb531437a54c0e6","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/noauth/V8Md2mMX83hrSowKk6qMS.jpeg","fullname":"Yuming Yang","name":"Umean","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"643cb0625fcffe09fb6ca688","name":"Fudan-University","fullname":"Fudan University","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6437eca0819f3ab20d162e14/kWv0cGlAhAG3iNWVxowkJ.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.14209","authors":[{"_id":"6970ff95c1c7409747bf9425","name":"Matthew Y.

Finally, we offer critical insights and outline future research directions to advance the development of data science agents.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.13591.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64c0e071e9263c783d548178","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64c0e071e9263c783d548178/VFwxjv7HFPwIoKIVGWLDg.png","fullname":"Maojun SUN","name":"Stephen-smj","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":1,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"646ecc368d316fde87b3b6e3","name":"PolyUHK","fullname":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/646ecbc0cbb7bb996513e298/Akb4zKqIP9kb9PQoUPUmj.jpeg"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.13253","authors":[{"_id":"6970725ba8be625b19c2afc9","user":{"_id":"669a4ffa2dbf53ccd2fa585b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/dc4149f72466abdde598d6fde12a5ac3.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ebubekir Tosun","user":"etosun","type":"user"},"name":"Ebubekir Tosun","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-21T09:18:58.918Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6970725ba8be625b19c2afca","name":"Mehmet Emin Buldur","hidden":false},{"_id":"6970725ba8be625b19c2afcb","name":"Özay Ezerceli","hidden":false},{"_id":"6970725ba8be625b19c2afcc","user":{"_id":"6422eab8e2029ade06eeee2c","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6422eab8e2029ade06eeee2c/Gai3BHr2WJ0YuhdumqQ_z.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Mahmud ElHuseyni 🇵🇸","user":"MElHuseyni","type":"user"},"name":"Mahmoud ElHussieni","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-21T09:19:01.567Z","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-19T17:38:52.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-21T04:01:25.570Z","title":"A Hybrid Protocol for Large-Scale Semantic Dataset Generation in Low-Resource Languages: The Turkish Semantic Relations Corpus","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6422eab8e2029ade06eeee2c","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6422eab8e2029ade06eeee2c/Gai3BHr2WJ0YuhdumqQ_z.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Mahmud ElHuseyni 🇵🇸","user":"MElHuseyni","type":"user"},"summary":"We present a hybrid methodology for generating large-scale semantic relationship datasets in low-resource languages, demonstrated through a comprehensive Turkish semantic relations corpus.

Yet, existing AL methods are unable to consistently outperform improved random sampling baselines adapted to 3D data, leaving the field without a reliable solution. We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning. Within the nnActive framework, we present compelling evidence that an AL method can consistently outperform random baselines adapted to 3D segmentation, in terms of both performance and annotation efficiency in a realistic, close-to-production scenario. Our open-source implementation and clear deployment guidelines make it readily applicable in practice.
