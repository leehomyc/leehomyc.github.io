Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.21204.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"663a9ae58cf658ffaf3d02e5","avatarUrl":"/avatars/aa35668dc088e675e794b9ceb935c56f.svg","fullname":"Junchen Liu","name":"JunchenLiu","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"60262b67268c201cdc8b7d43","name":"nvidia","fullname":"NVIDIA","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1613114437487-60262a8e0703121c822a80b6.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.21202","authors":[{"_id":"699f21fbebfce7fbcca919cd","name":"Hanxiang Qin","hidden":false},{"_id":"699f21fbebfce7fbcca919ce","name":"Alexander Martin","hidden":false},{"_id":"699f21fbebfce7fbcca919cf","name":"Rohan Jha","hidden":false},{"_id":"699f21fbebfce7fbcca919d0","name":"Chunsheng Zuo","hidden":false},{"_id":"699f21fbebfce7fbcca919d1","name":"Reno Kriz","hidden":false},{"_id":"699f21fbebfce7fbcca919d2","name":"Benjamin Van Durme","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-24T18:57:33.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-25T13:53:39.027Z","title":"Multi-Vector Index Compression in Any Modality","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"644ffb154f731658826945c8","avatarUrl":"/avatars/46fa3a15c2b974692bee5b6ed6468be0.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Alex Martin","user":"alexmartin1722","type":"user"},"summary":"We study efficient multi-vector retrieval for late interaction in any modality.

Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20309.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6841378dcb9938c7aed795be","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/WNI8gQVHdWyt0OvmRINDp.png","fullname":"Haokun Lin","name":"Felix1023","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":4,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.16990","authors":[{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb53","user":{"_id":"65d76cc5b9b7b8bf88faa916","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d95232cd0c307efab6197ade1a66190b.svg","isPro":true,"fullname":"Yan Wang","user":"YanAdjeNole","type":"user"},"name":"Yan Wang","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-25T17:29:21.546Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb54","name":"Yi Han","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb55","name":"Lingfei Qian","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb56","name":"Yueru He","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb57","name":"Xueqing Peng","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb58","name":"Dongji Feng","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb59","name":"Zhuohan Xie","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb5a","name":"Vincent Jim Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb5b","name":"Rosie Guo","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb5c","name":"Fengran Mo","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb5d","name":"Jimin Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb5e","name":"Yankai Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb5f","name":"Xue Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e71d6dfbcf0b800aecb60","name":"Jian-Yun Nie","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-19T01:29:50.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-25T01:23:32.378Z","title":"Conv-FinRe: A Conversational and Longitudinal Benchmark for Utility-Grounded Financial Recommendation","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"65d76cc5b9b7b8bf88faa916","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d95232cd0c307efab6197ade1a66190b.svg","isPro":true,"fullname":"Yan Wang","user":"YanAdjeNole","type":"user"},"summary":"Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior.

Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20731.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"655df11f82afda0fc47c421d","avatarUrl":"/avatars/f0ea4317e6010b28392d85bb94dd2230.svg","fullname":"Aram Davtyan","name":"araachie","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"655e6783c0a20e9dbb031680","name":"cvg-unibe","fullname":"Computer Vision Group @ University of Bern","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/655df11f82afda0fc47c421d/ldC46bZlib6DB8Endhy9N.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.19633","authors":[{"_id":"699e2e67dfbcf0b800aeca26","user":{"_id":"654224d4eccc4f48dcea725d","avatarUrl":"/avatars/a325691bac8e3ff53dddd96c22d7fa67.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jongwon Jeong","user":"jongwon-jeong","type":"user"},"name":"Jongwon Jeong","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-25T17:30:24.033Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e2e67dfbcf0b800aeca27","name":"Jungtaek Kim","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e2e67dfbcf0b800aeca28","name":"Kangwook Lee","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-23T09:19:56.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-25T15:51:24.022Z","title":"TAPE: Tool-Guided Adaptive Planning and Constrained Execution in Language Model Agents","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"654224d4eccc4f48dcea725d","avatarUrl":"/avatars/a325691bac8e3ff53dddd96c22d7fa67.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jongwon Jeong","user":"jongwon-jeong","type":"user"},"summary":"Language Model (LM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving tasks that require multiple interactions with the environment.

Our results suggest that evaluator-guided LLM program evolution is a practical path towards automatic discovery of novel ranking algorithms.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.16932.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64aebfa77b3b338666286b5b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/75d23cab7e6912dcf6a6602c994853a3.svg","fullname":"Jinming Nian","name":"jnian","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"67b90a8f4535b84d0b6630fb","name":"SCU-IR","fullname":"Santa Clara University IR Group","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63656d3112188d67e659a85c/u0yiG_YKp8nZKt0V6YI3F.jpeg"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.16813","authors":[{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a82","name":"Chanhyuk Lee","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a83","name":"Jaehoon Yoo","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a84","name":"Manan Agarwal","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a85","name":"Sheel Shah","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a86","name":"Jerry Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a87","name":"Aditi Raghunathan","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a88","name":"Seunghoon Hong","hidden":false},{"_id":"699da378b767f258d0bf1a89","name":"Nicholas M.

Our work fills a gap in VTR optimization, providing a foundational step towards reliable and structural faithful visual text generation.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20903.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"662213b3c819b7ce3d41f987","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/662213b3c819b7ce3d41f987/cSdLQy5YbbaTokzKXMtrS.jpeg","fullname":"Hanshen Zhu","name":"CIawevy","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.20540","authors":[{"_id":"699e89c1dfbcf0b800aecb9b","name":"Minseop Kim","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e89c1dfbcf0b800aecb9c","name":"Takhyeong Kim","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e89c1dfbcf0b800aecb9d","user":{"_id":"64ba75761d0a5a5760874197","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64ba75761d0a5a5760874197/5V3jxX-vim-wMaU2Zjz5h.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"TaekHyunPark","user":"Thrillcrazyer","type":"user"},"name":"Taekhyun Park","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-25T17:29:08.802Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e89c1dfbcf0b800aecb9e","name":"Hanbyeol Park","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e89c1dfbcf0b800aecb9f","name":"Hyerim Bae","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-24T04:38:31.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-25T03:47:43.183Z","title":"Generative AI and Machine Learning Collaboration for Container Dwell Time Prediction via Data Standardization","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64ba75761d0a5a5760874197","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64ba75761d0a5a5760874197/5V3jxX-vim-wMaU2Zjz5h.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"TaekHyunPark","user":"Thrillcrazyer","type":"user"},"summary":"Import container dwell time (ICDT) prediction is a key task for improving productivity in container terminals, as accurate predictions enable the reduction of container re-handling operations by yard cranes. Achieving this objective requires accurately predicting the dwell time of individual containers.

This study addresses this limitation by proposing a collaborative framework that integrates generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) with machine learning. The proposed framework employs Gen AI to standardize unstructured information into standard international codes, with dynamic re-prediction triggered by electronic data interchange state updates, enabling the machine learning model to predict ICDT accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on real container terminal data demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves a 13.88% improvement in mean absolute error compared to conventional models that do not utilize standardized information. Furthermore, applying the improved predictions to container stacking strategies achieves up to 14.68% reduction in the number of relocations, thereby empirically validating the potential of Gen AI to enhance productivity in container terminal operations.
