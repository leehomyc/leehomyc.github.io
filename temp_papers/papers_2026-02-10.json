Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.07026.png","numComments":5,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64084fa192033c150738e4f2","avatarUrl":"/avatars/dfff2216eb235c635e5abe6fda3084f0.svg","fullname":"Yu_xm","name":"Yu2020","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":5,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.08222","authors":[{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b227","user":{"_id":"64afe1653361f887816da303","avatarUrl":"/avatars/320d71adacfad9dd5db064b4ed3dec2b.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"chenzehao","user":"chhao","type":"user"},"name":"Zehao Chen","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-10T09:04:42.021Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b228","name":"Gongxun Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b229","name":"Tianxiang Ai","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b22a","name":"Yifei Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b22b","name":"Zixuan Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b22c","name":"Wang Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b22d","name":"Fuzhen Zhuang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b22e","name":"Xianglong Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b22f","name":"Jianxin Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b230","name":"Deqing Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ad20e1b2dc6b37d61b231","user":{"_id":"68345345f4bbf856e2d708e2","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/68345345f4bbf856e2d708e2/L5H2HNCuWje3ti2tNbC5p.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yikun B","user":"Yikunb","type":"user"},"name":"Yikun Ban","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-10T09:04:44.617Z","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-09T02:50:40.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-10T04:36:28.975Z","title":"Weak-Driven Learning: How Weak Agents make Strong Agents Stronger","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"68345345f4bbf856e2d708e2","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/68345345f4bbf856e2d708e2/L5H2HNCuWje3ti2tNbC5p.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yikun B","user":"Yikunb","type":"user"},"summary":"As post-training optimization becomes central to improving large language models, we observe a persistent saturation bottleneck: once models grow highly confident, further training yields diminishing returns.

Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.08439.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"652965773a416e1f2173443b","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/652965773a416e1f2173443b/y9MB8YgHzbwCXAc4EI9T3.jpeg","fullname":"Yuhao Dong","name":"THUdyh","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":50,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"62d55f243bf5e059f7ca25ba","name":"mmlab-ntu","fullname":"MMLab@NTU","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1658151991971-62b5777f593a2c49da69dc02.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.06025","authors":[{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b8c","name":"Haozhen Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b8d","name":"Haodong Yue","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b8e","name":"Tao Feng","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b8f","name":"Quanyu Long","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b90","name":"Jianzhu Bao","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b91","name":"Bowen Jin","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b92","name":"Weizhi Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b93","name":"Xiao Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b94","name":"Jiaxuan You","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b95","name":"Chengwei Qin","hidden":false},{"_id":"698608f09c78be977c104b96","name":"Wenya Wang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-05T18:57:09.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-10T05:16:01.749Z","title":"Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64f58f3468047192d6c7f335","avatarUrl":"/avatars/88be16ee80da7d2eaa0feae878375001.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"XaiverZ","user":"XaiverZ","type":"user"},"summary":"Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information.

Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination.

Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84times average inference speedup. Our results provide empirical evidence that chemical reasoning is more naturally and effectively realized as continuous latent dynamics rather than discretized linguistic trajectories.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.07075.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63357c608adfa81faf2ac180","avatarUrl":"/avatars/ae0314c644f882251baf59b9134fd36f.svg","fullname":"Xiangru Tang","name":"RTT1","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":7,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.08658","authors":[{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3bd","name":"Mingzi Cao","hidden":false},{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3be","name":"Xingwei Tan","hidden":false},{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3bf","name":"Mahmud Akhter","hidden":false},{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3c0","name":"Marco Valentino","hidden":false},{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3c1","name":"Maria Liakata","hidden":false},{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3c2","name":"Xi Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698b0ddf1b2dc6b37d61b3c3","name":"Nikolaos Aletras","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-09T13:51:48.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-10T09:25:38.803Z","title":"Fundamental Reasoning Paradigms Induce Out-of-Domain Generalization in Language Models","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"643d0a4d8a55b2bbf4f2a90e","avatarUrl":"/avatars/9534aaf81cbf12f015c6826b682fdb84.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Xingwei Tan","user":"XingweiT","type":"user"},"summary":"Deduction, induction, and abduction are fundamental reasoning paradigms, core for human logical thinking.

Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.08236.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63ee8fb05f1300034de097fd","avatarUrl":"/avatars/bceedb88927d8633948266503c2dd0b1.svg","fullname":"Yu","name":"Shoubin","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"669f9d1fec8789263c0e355a","name":"UNC-ChapelHill","fullname":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/669f9c85bd649dba3b88e581/H5uB8_MCewnMtxEUnAvTL.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.07775","authors":[{"_id":"698ac1fc1b2dc6b37d61b183","name":"Haodong Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ac1fc1b2dc6b37d61b184","name":"Shaoteng Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ac1fc1b2dc6b37d61b185","name":"Zhe Lin","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ac1fc1b2dc6b37d61b186","name":"Manmohan Chandraker","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/5LzL-wYavOE2BRuVcFIqL.mp4"],"publishedAt":"2026-02-08T02:16:02.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-10T02:58:29.492Z","title":"Rolling Sink: Bridging Limited-Horizon Training and Open-Ended Testing in Autoregressive Video Diffusion","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","isPro":true,"fullname":"taesiri","user":"taesiri","type":"user"},"summary":"Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance.

Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods.

Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance.

Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations.

Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.05929.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64593836c16ecb4815e082ce","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64593836c16ecb4815e082ce/cHv6bOowt4N7n-dweNozO.jpeg","fullname":"Jian Chen","name":"puar-playground","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":6,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"65990dffc6457161ca82d1f1","name":"Tele-AI","fullname":"Tele-AI","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64368160eef1f55654ab21dc/sLbwBxn-8iokBAxwk0vpB.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.05708","authors":[{"_id":"6989dffebeecc443208d28de","name":"Chuangtao Ma","hidden":false},{"_id":"6989dffebeecc443208d28df","name":"Zeyu Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6989dffebeecc443208d28e0","name":"Arijit Khan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6989dffebeecc443208d28e1","name":"Sebastian Schelter","hidden":false},{"_id":"6989dffebeecc443208d28e2","name":"Paul Groth","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-05T14:33:00.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-10T10:30:25.979Z","title":"Cost-Efficient RAG for Entity Matching with LLMs: A Blocking-based Exploration","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"66c8b6e42400073af3219888","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/66c8b6e42400073af3219888/iZiwL_KwhNboAGg0RKUAy.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Chuangtao Ma","user":"ctma","type":"user"},"summary":"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLM reasoning in knowledge-intensive tasks, but existing RAG pipelines incur substantial retrieval and generation overhead when applied to large-scale entity matching.

Overall, our findings provide a quantitative snapshot of agent skills as an emerging infrastructure layer for agents and inform future work on skill reuse, standardization, and safety-aware design.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64311e8edd466752c73ab69a/ChnbbFpMVTbwvErxpR_dw.png"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.08004.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64311e8edd466752c73ab69a","avatarUrl":"/avatars/34f559399e57534ee9883029c8b91ccf.svg","fullname":"Shanshan Zhong","name":"zhongshsh","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":1,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.07125","authors":[{"_id":"698ba5a76052d3bed96308ed","name":"Jianrui Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ba5a76052d3bed96308ee","name":"Anirudh Sundara Rajan","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ba5a76052d3bed96308ef","name":"Brandon Han","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ba5a76052d3bed96308f0","name":"Soochahn Lee","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ba5a76052d3bed96308f1","name":"Sukanta Ganguly","hidden":false},{"_id":"698ba5a76052d3bed96308f2","name":"Yong Jae Lee","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-06T19:01:54.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-10T19:10:46.415Z","title":"Reasoning-Augmented Representations for Multimodal Retrieval","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6508b164abdde5290e5e4939","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6508b164abdde5290e5e4939/lQgAs3BHwCyI7Go1QA62m.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Harris Zhang","user":"HanSolo9682","type":"user"},"summary":"Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) seeks any-to-any search across text and vision, yet modern embedding models remain brittle when queries require latent reasoning (e.g., resolving underspecified references or matching compositional constraints).
