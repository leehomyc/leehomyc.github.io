Our code and models are available.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.16093.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63958b4414513eaf9029ebf1","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/U1g5H071pWRswGAG9UTpo.png","fullname":"Xiangtai Li","name":"LXT","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":13,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"653b817d32c97d0655575872","name":"ByteDance","fullname":"ByteDance","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6535c9e88bde2fae19b6fb25/0clr54wj5Ly-RkYU9OXPp.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.16175","authors":[{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c2","name":"Mert Yuksekgonul","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c3","name":"Daniel Koceja","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c4","name":"Xinhao Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c5","name":"Federico Bianchi","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c6","name":"Jed McCaleb","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c7","name":"Xiaolong Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c8","name":"Jan Kautz","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73c9","name":"Yejin Choi","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73ca","name":"James Zou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73cb","name":"Carlos Guestrin","hidden":false},{"_id":"6972e02afb12c92b735b73cc","name":"Yu Sun","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-22T18:24:00.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-23T00:15:05.275Z","title":"Learning to Discover at Test Time","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"603f7c7af84ebe399f1c85cf","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1625214886903-603f7c7af84ebe399f1c85cf.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Federico Bianchi","user":"vinid","type":"user"},"summary":"How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem?

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation.

We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in advanced reasoning to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in autonomous agents to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in reinforcement learning to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/638511e616ccd1034bb3a220/W5lS-40uxGzRiWksrzXvm.png"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.15690.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"638511e616ccd1034bb3a220","avatarUrl":"/avatars/8c4906cf559941b1043a2a04a6456cd3.svg","fullname":"Jiaxin Zhang","name":"zhangjiaxin2012","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"64e2dbe32fbff6ed9cf0a678","name":"Saleforce","fullname":"Salesforce","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64e2dbce8367d2da8ba618f2/u1ulbo4ifz1X4DV_ZwyPg.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.15440","authors":[{"_id":"69731ad1fb12c92b735b7578","user":{"_id":"68d51061ab9204b0c8a0ceb2","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/68d51061ab9204b0c8a0ceb2/CVmg6wo4yBqIZgGZUYSX8.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Sandy Hardian Susanto Herho","user":"sandyherho","type":"user"},"name":"Sandy H.
