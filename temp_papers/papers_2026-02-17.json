However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities.

However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment.

Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.13823.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"659bb678e57c59004625c624","avatarUrl":"/avatars/32b395c3504acb1fe29cceb65508b351.svg","fullname":"Voyage_Wang","name":"VoyageWang","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"628735cbc83a2d6ab8d14a66","name":"Tsinghua","fullname":"Tsinghua University"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.12876","authors":[{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d2d","name":"Huanyao Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d2e","name":"Jiepeng Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d2f","name":"Bo Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d30","name":"Bowen Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d31","name":"Yanzhe Dan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d32","name":"Haishan Lu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d33","name":"Zhiyong Cao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d34","name":"Jiaoyang Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d35","name":"Yuqian Han","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d36","name":"Zinan Sheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d37","name":"Zhengwei Tao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d38","name":"Hao Liang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d39","name":"Jialong Wu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d3a","name":"Yang Shi","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d3b","name":"Yuanpeng He","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d3c","name":"Jiaye Lin","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d3d","name":"Qintong Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d3e","name":"Guochen Yan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d3f","name":"Runhao Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d40","name":"Zhengpin Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d41","name":"Xiaohan Yu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d42","name":"Lang Mei","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d43","name":"Chong Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d44","name":"Wentao Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6993e3db50fb2c0be4783d45","name":"Bin Cui","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-13T12:25:13.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-17T01:13:32.734Z","title":"BrowseComp-V^3: A Visual, Vertical, and Verifiable Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","isPro":true,"fullname":"taesiri","user":"taesiri","type":"user"},"summary":"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), equipped with increasingly advanced planning and tool-use capabilities, are evolving into autonomous agents capable of performing multimodal web browsing and deep search in open-world environments.

We construct a 1.6B-sample training corpus, comprising 900M text-to-image and 700M image editing pairs from diverse sources. After rigorous cleaning, stratification, auto-labeling, and two-stage filtering, we retain over 100M high-quality samples balanced between generation and editing, ensuring strong semantic coverage and instruction alignment. Our multi-stage training pipeline progressively builds editing capability via pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. To improve data efficiency, we introduce a Multi-Condition Aware Bucket Sampler for variable-resolution batching and Stochastic Instruction Alignment with dynamic prompt re-indexing. To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation.

We construct a 1.6B-sample training corpus, comprising 900M text-to-image and 700M image editing pairs from diverse sources. After rigorous cleaning, stratification, auto-labeling, and two-stage filtering, we retain over 100M high-quality samples balanced between generation and editing, ensuring strong semantic coverage and instruction alignment. Our multi-stage training pipeline progressively builds editing capability via pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. To improve data efficiency, we introduce a Multi-Condition Aware Bucket Sampler for variable-resolution batching and Stochastic Instruction Alignment with dynamic prompt re-indexing. To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.14941.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"646e86350867c99c2d3f2ecf","avatarUrl":"/avatars/b89798ff623abffb169eacda2ac32fde.svg","fullname":"Han Lin","name":"hanlincs","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"669f9d1fec8789263c0e355a","name":"UNC-ChapelHill","fullname":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/669f9c85bd649dba3b88e581/H5uB8_MCewnMtxEUnAvTL.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.14689","authors":[{"_id":"69941f8550fb2c0be4783df1","name":"Lukas Struppek","hidden":false},{"_id":"69941f8550fb2c0be4783df2","name":"Adam Gleave","hidden":false},{"_id":"69941f8550fb2c0be4783df3","name":"Kellin Pelrine","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6305ca82d37ce67e0e48aadb/uYonLHu4SGpeT2VzH4Jbk.png"],"publishedAt":"2026-02-16T12:24:21.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-17T05:29:18.761Z","title":"Exposing the Systematic Vulnerability of Open-Weight Models to Prefill Attacks","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6305ca82d37ce67e0e48aadb","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6305ca82d37ce67e0e48aadb/gyTcyIURKmXSFXtr07FGu.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Lukas Struppek","user":"lukas-struppek","type":"user"},"summary":"As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse.

However, recent studies show that knowledge-extraction attacks can recover sensitive knowledge-base content through maliciously crafted queries, raising serious concerns about intellectual property theft and privacy leakage. While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets.

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops.
