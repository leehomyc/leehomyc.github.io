However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills.

However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills.

We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.14279.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"654875f69295970f87ba1600","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4c387aa53053f88444e7d8fffd6161c1.svg","fullname":"Ruomeng Ding","name":"Czardas","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"69975b0f28c030b6655b8d20","name":"ZDCSlab","fullname":"ZD Lab @ UNC-Chapel Hill"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.13576","authors":[{"_id":"69976a4c7a658569d5a100d0","name":"Ruomeng Ding","hidden":false},{"_id":"69976a4c7a658569d5a100d1","name":"Yifei Pang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69976a4c7a658569d5a100d2","name":"He Sun","hidden":false},{"_id":"69976a4c7a658569d5a100d3","name":"Yizhong Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69976a4c7a658569d5a100d4","name":"Zhiwei Steven Wu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69976a4c7a658569d5a100d5","name":"Zhun Deng","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-14T03:19:14.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-23T18:24:55.565Z","title":"Rubrics as an Attack Surface: Stealthy Preference Drift in LLM Judges","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"654875f69295970f87ba1600","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4c387aa53053f88444e7d8fffd6161c1.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ruomeng Ding","user":"Czardas","type":"user"},"summary":"Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.
