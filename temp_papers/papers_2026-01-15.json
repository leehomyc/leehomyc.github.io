First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate A^3-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.09274.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"658be7fe135580745c510323","avatarUrl":"/avatars/830e5cec4565efdc23226a86a0fcef0e.svg","fullname":"Jian Zhang","name":"VentureZJ","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":4,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"66a92d5a58cff488d93ab512","name":"XianJiaotongUniversity","fullname":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/66a92ba2f351acac61ba119c/6zLTkLwBLMbRLR1y7tfpC.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.09088","authors":[{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6aeb","user":{"_id":"6463345cd2044cd1d7c613a8","avatarUrl":"/avatars/242cbf2479877e836f931d17a6190660.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Shaotian","user":"ystluffy","type":"user"},"name":"Shaotian Yan","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-15T09:33:27.639Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6aec","name":"Kaiyuan Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6aed","user":{"_id":"64b73e3830a0b8ff60145a29","avatarUrl":"/avatars/297469812b57b2ddf7d52b9391d80bde.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Chen Shen","user":"zjushenchen","type":"user"},"name":"Chen Shen","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-15T09:33:19.260Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6aee","user":{"_id":"6225b0d87f5fba1007d62fae","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6225b0d87f5fba1007d62fae/clONu5C-lkoSswcJjcG0u.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Bing Wang","user":"wangbing1416","type":"user"},"name":"Bing Wang","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-15T09:33:17.091Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6aef","user":{"_id":"694a226980a37f293a4ce7c0","avatarUrl":"/avatars/7a48f4eeb80a1b5688cbfb10a59765a0.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Sinan Fan","user":"sinan25","type":"user"},"name":"Sinan Fan","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-15T09:33:14.748Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6af0","name":"Jun Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6af1","name":"Yue Wu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6af2","name":"Zheng Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69688bbc0ac10a06522f6af3","name":"Jieping Ye","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-14T02:43:17.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-15T07:24:58.461Z","title":"Distribution-Aligned Sequence Distillation for Superior Long-CoT Reasoning","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6463345cd2044cd1d7c613a8","avatarUrl":"/avatars/242cbf2479877e836f931d17a6190660.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Shaotian","user":"ystluffy","type":"user"},"summary":"In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model.

Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks.

(2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%).","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.07287.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"68fce03ed1d0efce7ca87075","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/68fce03ed1d0efce7ca87075/GRKTeVIaLZD_M-KoJE8YF.png","fullname":"yfdeng","name":"yfdeng10","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.06794","authors":[{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e2","name":"Zhicong Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e3","name":"Lingjie Jiang","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e4","name":"Yulan Hu","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e5","name":"Xingchen Zeng","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e6","name":"Yixia Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e7","name":"Xiangwen Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e8","name":"Guanhua Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9e9","name":"Zheng Pan","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9ea","name":"Xin Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"696918718854afb90e2fc9eb","name":"Yong Liu","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-11T07:29:08.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-15T14:10:44.196Z","title":"No More Stale Feedback: Co-Evolving Critics for Open-World Agent Learning","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"66ab80e9bfb7d73a56bc293c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/9644266304c832c74ef572b5eb2d9468.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jack","user":"lingjie23","type":"user"},"summary":"Critique-guided reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training LLM agents by augmenting sparse outcome rewards with natural-language feedback.
