These results validate that formal verification can serve as a scalable mechanism to significantly push the performance boundaries of advanced LLM reasoning.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.22642.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64c1e3a911c6194a55d974df","avatarUrl":"/avatars/db7c37ba78b726a5646221bf9bc4cc6c.svg","fullname":"Chuxue Cao","name":"chuxuecao","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"6609f50bf4ab651901ae4541","name":"hongkongust","fullname":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.21468","authors":[{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d0","name":"Yaorui Shi","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d1","name":"Shugui Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d2","name":"Yu Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d3","name":"Wenyu Mao","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d4","name":"Yuxin Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d5","name":"Qi GU","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d6","name":"Hui Su","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d7","name":"Xunliang Cai","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d8","name":"Xiang Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c7da1a67238fac88cc2d9","name":"An Zhang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T09:47:17.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-02T01:45:23.265Z","title":"MemOCR: Layout-Aware Visual Memory for Efficient Long-Horizon Reasoning","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"63edd2d1f765928ceeb49057","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1676530369930-noauth.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yaorui SHI","user":"yrshi","type":"user"},"summary":"Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window.

This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.21358.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"652275e1d65824bda7a845db","avatarUrl":"/avatars/ae465143a480e4f739c3c4c544490f25.svg","fullname":"jc","name":"yunsaijc","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"63ba7720fc454697637969f1","name":"Beihang","fullname":"Beihang University","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63ba7666c138c8f2b7844b58/n98lZU9VWxYgWIkzE_6o4.jpeg"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.21419","authors":[{"_id":"697c1dfca67238fac88cc0a4","name":"Qing Jin","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c1dfca67238fac88cc0a5","name":"Chaoyang Wang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T08:56:55.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-02T04:06:18.035Z","title":"Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64c166de11f3f1d23a99c6fd","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d4730f70a6f1cb51266862c7a8d54f77.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Chaoyang Wang","user":"cwang9","type":"user"},"summary":"Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise (varepsilon) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings.

On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.15625.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"65328aa39326d6da5ff19b52","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5c3de984cd6eba69616bb608796865c5.svg","fullname":"Fei Zhao","name":"Hiiamein","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.22141","authors":[{"_id":"697c8d096676f93322706032","user":{"_id":"632dc132fdb35759ea673fbf","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4ba2879965150820170d96b610cfccd2.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Grzegorz Stefański","user":"GrzegorzStefanski","type":"user"},"name":"Grzegorz Stefanski","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-30T13:31:28.141Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c8d096676f93322706033","name":"Alberto Presta","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c8d096676f93322706034","name":"Michal Byra","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T18:56:41.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-02T01:00:24.563Z","title":"Routing the Lottery: Adaptive Subnetworks for Heterogeneous Data","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"632dc132fdb35759ea673fbf","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4ba2879965150820170d96b610cfccd2.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Grzegorz Stefański","user":"GrzegorzStefanski","type":"user"},"summary":"In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts.

Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.15394.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63c38f888cc87cf0c06abfe9","avatarUrl":"/avatars/e99b662404fb805870d95e0f1f17167b.svg","fullname":"Jay","name":"jaydeepb","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"5e63d8713071d5be688861b8","name":"facebook","fullname":"AI at Meta","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1592839207516-noauth.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.23134","authors":[{"_id":"69804c7d6676f933227066c6","user":{"_id":"653053c6657ae56cdb5c490b","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/653053c6657ae56cdb5c490b/Zl0bZZ7-tD9AR6muE8esU.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Peter Hu","user":"Peter2023HuggingFace","type":"user"},"name":"Zheyuan Hu","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-02T16:52:09.611Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69804c7d6676f933227066c7","name":"Yifei Shi","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-30T16:23:06.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-02T04:35:07.481Z","title":"Machine Learning for Energy-Performance-aware Scheduling","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"653053c6657ae56cdb5c490b","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/653053c6657ae56cdb5c490b/Zl0bZZ7-tD9AR6muE8esU.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Peter Hu","user":"Peter2023HuggingFace","type":"user"},"summary":"In the post-Dennard era, optimizing embedded systems requires navigating complex trade-offs between energy efficiency and latency.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.
