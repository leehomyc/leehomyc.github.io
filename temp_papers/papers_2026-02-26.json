To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.21818.png","numComments":4,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","fullname":"taesiri","name":"taesiri","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":240,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"6522615d9334173c627b0efa","name":"Skywork","fullname":"Skywork","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64535b71bcbd25618f7655da/AvtJ4GuPAyhLxl2-leVt6.jpeg"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.21534","authors":[{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b4d","name":"Xiaoxuan Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b4e","name":"Han Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b4f","name":"Haixin Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b50","name":"Yidan Shi","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b51","name":"Ruoyan Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b52","name":"Kaiqiao Han","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b53","name":"Chenyi Tong","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b54","name":"Haoran Deng","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b55","name":"Renliang Sun","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b56","name":"Alexander Taylor","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b57","name":"Yanqiao Zhu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b58","name":"Jason Cong","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b59","name":"Yizhou Sun","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fbaf1ebfce7fbcca91b5a","name":"Wei Wang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-25T03:43:34.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-26T00:47:18.994Z","title":"ARLArena: A Unified Framework for Stable Agentic Reinforcement Learning","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64ba5946c0f19c9025665a3c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/bb148094ce52f1f385d30968dc22e0e6.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Xiaoxuan Wang","user":"xw27","type":"user"},"summary":"Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) has rapidly gained attention as a promising paradigm for training agents to solve complex, multi-step interactive tasks.

VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.21461.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63318b2349a9563915469f3b","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63318b2349a9563915469f3b/zlbeB2997i8YkoyOTb9FL.jpeg","fullname":"Xiaoke Huang","name":"xk-huang","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":8,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"5e63d8713071d5be688861b8","name":"facebook","fullname":"AI at Meta","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1592839207516-noauth.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.19163","authors":[{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad0","name":"Kai Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad1","name":"Yanhao Zheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad2","name":"Kai Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad3","name":"Shengqiong Wu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad4","name":"Rongjunchen Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad5","name":"Jiebo Luo","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad6","name":"Dimitrios Hatzinakos","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad7","name":"Ziwei Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad8","name":"Hao Fei","hidden":false},{"_id":"699fb334ebfce7fbcca91ad9","name":"Tat-Seng Chua","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/678bdcbe600666579235a1f3/BdSUgdHoEbTgTu6tHanG1.mp4","https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/678bdcbe600666579235a1f3/bhNigK8NVUKgJ33WobH4i.jpeg","https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/678bdcbe600666579235a1f3/kggZ01w0SeC0sb3YHCq6m.jpeg","https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/678bdcbe600666579235a1f3/fUrz6yQZoxYotNr_YL5E-.jpeg"],"publishedAt":"2026-02-22T12:44:28.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-26T00:22:24.649Z","title":"JavisDiT++: Unified Modeling and Optimization for Joint Audio-Video Generation","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"678bdcbe600666579235a1f3","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/FoPxPc-T3xbzzkgQkrIbg.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"KAI LIU","user":"kkail8","type":"user"},"summary":"AIGC has rapidly expanded from text-to-image generation toward high-quality multimodal synthesis across video and audio.

Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.21778.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"5f7fbd813e94f16a85448745","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1649681653581-5f7fbd813e94f16a85448745.jpeg","fullname":"Sayak Paul","name":"sayakpaul","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":true,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":859,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.20122","authors":[{"_id":"699e0a50dfbcf0b800aec9be","user":{"_id":"698aac36282aa3513435f270","avatarUrl":"/avatars/0c80739ff7ae481bd9561351c6584c32.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Lingwei Gu","user":"LingweiGu","type":"user"},"name":"Lingwei Gu","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-26T10:02:47.990Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e0a50dfbcf0b800aec9bf","user":{"_id":"663113ed3e584ce1d96b1d32","avatarUrl":"/avatars/28154c3c0ac3bb100dceed1c760d5fd3.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Nour Jedidi","user":"njedidi","type":"user"},"name":"Nour Jedidi","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-26T10:02:44.297Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e0a50dfbcf0b800aec9c0","name":"Jimmy Lin","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-23T18:37:49.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-26T03:21:35.457Z","title":"NanoKnow: How to Know What Your Language Model Knows","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"663113ed3e584ce1d96b1d32","avatarUrl":"/avatars/28154c3c0ac3bb100dceed1c760d5fd3.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Nour Jedidi","user":"njedidi","type":"user"},"summary":"How do large language models (LLMs) know what they know?

However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.\n  Hence, we examine 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers empirically, assess their description quality, and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, and then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly.

Towards Improving AI Agent Efficiency with Augmented MCP Tool Descriptions","summary":"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces a standard specification that defines how Foundation Model (FM)-based agents should interact with external systems by invoking tools. However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.\n  Hence, we examine 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers empirically, assess their description quality, and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, and then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases.

We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones.

We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies.
