Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63f47b5321eb234ab739e91a/p9cPxETttQUS23woFb14M.mp4"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.22153.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63f47b5321eb234ab739e91a","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63f47b5321eb234ab739e91a/vWfFNVtMkHl8gieha5PPd.jpeg","fullname":"Haozhe Xie","name":"hzxie","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":19,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"62d55f243bf5e059f7ca25ba","name":"mmlab-ntu","fullname":"MMLab@NTU","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1658151991971-62b5777f593a2c49da69dc02.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2601.21639","authors":[{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc226","user":{"_id":"693f91d7ed7d40c019934508","avatarUrl":"/avatars/0d73f098627c9ebd2ae7d90e693a34f6.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yufeng Zhong","user":"Albert-Zhong","type":"user"},"name":"Yufeng Zhong","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-30T09:35:23.719Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc227","name":"Lei Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc228","name":"Xuanle Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc229","name":"Wenkang Han","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc22a","name":"Liming Zheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc22b","name":"Jing Huang","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc22c","name":"Deyang Jiang","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc22d","name":"Yilin Cao","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc22e","name":"Lin Ma","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5270a67238fac88cc22f","name":"Zhixiong Zeng","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T12:43:02.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-30T04:33:06.261Z","title":"OCRVerse: Towards Holistic OCR in End-to-End Vision-Language Models","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6572cbc42bb242937c0a1101","avatarUrl":"/avatars/f2af45e6b242aa47578fe3f60e97ca86.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Xuanle Zhao","user":"xxxllz","type":"user"},"summary":"The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular.

Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.21754.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"632ab8f5a968c34257da5c52","avatarUrl":"/avatars/59df09e6c9e1e633170514d950ad7981.svg","fullname":"Haotian Luo","name":"LordNoah","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":1,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"6508b28cf36bb51c50faad98","name":"NanyangTechnologicalUniversity","fullname":"Nanyang Technological University","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/630ca0817dacb93b33506ce7/ZPD1fvei0bcIGeDXxeSkn.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.22157","authors":[{"_id":"697c5bb6a67238fac88cc23d","name":"Jonathan Kahana","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5bb6a67238fac88cc23e","name":"Eliahu Horwitz","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c5bb6a67238fac88cc23f","name":"Yedid Hoshen","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T18:59:55.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-30T07:53:18.197Z","title":"Discovering Hidden Gems in Model Repositories","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6465fd33dac127ac80f0b334","avatarUrl":"/avatars/113f02c1b1f8d33d3487daa867afcd3f.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jonathan Kahana","user":"jonkahana","type":"user"},"summary":"Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints.

In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.21343.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","fullname":"taesiri","name":"taesiri","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":221,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"66b54027408752ae16404b05","name":"metaresearch","fullname":"Meta Research","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/66b25f3f58babfaeb76112dc/2GmiaF075AZ7BcE538oPk.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.22101","authors":[{"_id":"697c69e5a67238fac88cc270","user":{"_id":"6526b8ebba9a8279c139616b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/09f6b677603a03be128996a0765233e6.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Mahdi Nikdan","user":"mnikdan97","type":"user"},"name":"Mahdi Nikdan","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-01-30T13:31:32.261Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c69e5a67238fac88cc271","name":"Amir Zandieh","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c69e5a67238fac88cc272","name":"Dan Alistarh","hidden":false},{"_id":"697c69e5a67238fac88cc273","name":"Vahab Mirrokni","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T18:35:01.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-01-30T06:34:59.557Z","title":"ECO: Quantized Training without Full-Precision Master Weights","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6526b8ebba9a8279c139616b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/09f6b677603a03be128996a0765233e6.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Mahdi Nikdan","user":"mnikdan97","type":"user"},"summary":"Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training.

Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.","upvotes":2,"discussionId":"697cb1756676f933227060f0","ai_summary":"A lightweight LoRA adaptation of an audio-video diffusion model enables high-quality video dubbing with preserved speaker identity and improved lip synchronization through synthetic multilingual video training.","ai_keywords":["audio-video diffusion model","LoRA","video-to-video dubbing","generative model","multilingual videos","lip synchronization","speaker identity","audio-visual foundation models"]},"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T13:57:13.000Z","title":"JUST-DUB-IT: Video Dubbing via Joint Audio-Visual Diffusion","summary":"Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks.
