Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines. This report serves as an initial empirical contribution to that broader conversation.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20021.png","numComments":0,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","fullname":"taesiri","name":"taesiri","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":238,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.18996","authors":[{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4dd","user":{"_id":"662a1628b3f55ae101e20ca4","avatarUrl":"/avatars/9a56305a4b0909a429431c3b73e45efb.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Shannan Yan","user":"ysner","type":"user"},"name":"Shannan Yan","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-24T09:50:55.457Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4de","name":"Leqi Zheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4df","name":"Keyu Lv","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e0","name":"Jingchen Ni","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e1","name":"Hongyang Wei","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e2","name":"Jiajun Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e3","name":"Guangting Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e4","name":"Jing Lyu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e5","name":"Chun Yuan","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d12104e37ec6dfa1bc4e6","name":"Fengyun Rao","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-22T00:53:03.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-24T07:26:40.827Z","title":"Learning Cross-View Object Correspondence via Cycle-Consistent Mask Prediction","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"662a1628b3f55ae101e20ca4","avatarUrl":"/avatars/9a56305a4b0909a429431c3b73e45efb.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Shannan Yan","user":"ysner","type":"user"},"summary":"We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios.

To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/631321910b24eab4746a27c6/J7JN2NW3Vhu0puQJMn77-.jpeg"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.16872.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"631321910b24eab4746a27c6","avatarUrl":"/avatars/e43bc701ca53a5f19f0aaa4a0e1e059f.svg","fullname":"Sean Man","name":"seanman","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"65424e525bb41e82fba69276","name":"amazonwebservices","fullname":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/65424dd6afa1020a9c31759e/wt7-MpCfO2O8pVG8mISJS.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.19320","authors":[{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4b4","name":"Dongming Jiang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4b5","name":"Yi Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4b6","name":"Songtao Wei","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4b7","name":"Jinxin Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4b8","name":"Ayushi Kishore","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4b9","name":"Alysa Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4ba","name":"Dingyi Kang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4bb","name":"Xu Hu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4bc","name":"Feng Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4bd","name":"Qiannan Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d099b4e37ec6dfa1bc4be","name":"Bingzhe Li","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-22T19:50:01.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-24T14:22:10.059Z","title":"Anatomy of Agentic Memory: Taxonomy and Empirical Analysis of Evaluation and System Limitations","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"680f20f5f3cd7c68f689e156","avatarUrl":"/avatars/b572737cbf6b14223770e497dc3ac895.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"dj","user":"dj220001","type":"user"},"summary":"Agentic memory systems enable large language model (LLM) agents to maintain state across long interactions, supporting long-horizon reasoning and personalization beyond fixed context windows.

The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20160.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"62e9d5af6687b60b9c01240a","avatarUrl":"/avatars/3983be5662aa28aefcb18deaf08d7cb1.svg","fullname":"Chen Wang","name":"chenwang","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.18915","authors":[{"_id":"699d14764e37ec6dfa1bc4ff","name":"Mohammadreza Ghaffarzadeh-Esfahani","hidden":false},{"_id":"699d14764e37ec6dfa1bc500","name":"Yousof Gheisari","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/645d63c0ce72244df7b36be8/0GpwlhIgxtkJTNTlQbMNY.png"],"publishedAt":"2026-02-21T17:46:34.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-24T02:01:32.951Z","title":"AAVGen: Precision Engineering of Adeno-associated Viral Capsids for Renal Selective Targeting","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"645d63c0ce72244df7b36be8","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/645d63c0ce72244df7b36be8/09vhYAzgv1svwvQM4eIE9.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"MoRezaGH","user":"Moreza009","type":"user"},"summary":"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are promising vectors for gene therapy, but their native serotypes face limitations in tissue tropism, immune evasion, and production efficiency.

As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19455.png","numComments":0,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","fullname":"taesiri","name":"taesiri","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":238,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.19089","authors":[{"_id":"699e3334dfbcf0b800aeca2b","name":"Qi Sun","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e3334dfbcf0b800aeca2c","name":"Can Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e3334dfbcf0b800aeca2d","name":"Jiaxiang Shang","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e3334dfbcf0b800aeca2e","name":"Yingchun Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"699e3334dfbcf0b800aeca2f","name":"Jing Liao","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-22T08:07:28.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-24T20:55:38.129Z","title":"Ani3DHuman: Photorealistic 3D Human Animation with Self-guided Stochastic Sampling","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"667fb15d2698e0647180089d","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d550c82668a3819ce23706c7fdf19475.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Qi Sun","user":"qsun2001","type":"user"},"summary":"Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss.
