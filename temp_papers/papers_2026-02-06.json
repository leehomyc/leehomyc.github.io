To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains.

Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.21937.png","numComments":4,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6377366acc034ef804cf0aef","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6377366acc034ef804cf0aef/JHsET8LJE2w1E7vJD-R2o.png","fullname":"ShawnYing","name":"ShawnYing","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"67d1140985ea0644e2f14b99","name":"ByteDance-Seed","fullname":"ByteDance Seed","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6535c9e88bde2fae19b6fb25/flkDUqd_YEuFsjeNET3r-.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2601.21296","authors":[{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb09","user":{"_id":"66968099c952e09a4cb29f78","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/66968099c952e09a4cb29f78/n90NI2R3E9_RqCyMjDCQF.webp","isPro":false,"fullname":"Wang","user":"Steven-Shaobo","type":"user"},"name":"Shaobo Wang","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-06T18:52:05.358Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb0a","name":"Yantai Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb0b","name":"Guo Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb0c","name":"Peiru Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb0d","user":{"_id":"6346be8f7fb9f11870c63998","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6346be8f7fb9f11870c63998/tFWawSkXL6bv1zgvzFWQd.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Kaixin Li","user":"likaixin","type":"user"},"name":"Kaixin Li","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-06T18:52:02.746Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb0e","name":"Yufa Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb0f","name":"Zhaorun Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985591b4ad556f294b7eb10","name":"Linfeng Zhang","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-01-29T05:49:17.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:54.616Z","title":"Grounding and Enhancing Informativeness and Utility in Dataset Distillation","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"66968099c952e09a4cb29f78","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/66968099c952e09a4cb29f78/n90NI2R3E9_RqCyMjDCQF.webp","isPro":false,"fullname":"Wang","user":"Steven-Shaobo","type":"user"},"summary":"Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset.

When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ^2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.05842.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"61942296d5c2ba6daa290357","avatarUrl":"/avatars/594021cc183c4922d48b46f43772a062.svg","fullname":"Baolin Peng","name":"Baolin","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"organization":{"_id":"68151d0f51add3813f3f7d1b","name":"MicrosoftResearch","fullname":"Microsoft Research","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6529a4f2f1205983224fa513/PeuVr7jSuJflmDBBGxoDX.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.06036","authors":[{"_id":"69855f4e4ad556f294b7eb85","name":"Jian Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855f4e4ad556f294b7eb86","name":"Yesheng Liang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855f4e4ad556f294b7eb87","name":"Zhijian Liu","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-05T18:59:30.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-06T18:47:30.008Z","title":"DFlash: Block Diffusion for Flash Speculative Decoding","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"65cb103a11a80579a4e08fd5","avatarUrl":"/avatars/443183d292131ad1c74a3a766de2919a.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Jian Chen","user":"jianchen0311","type":"user"},"summary":"Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization.

Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.06034.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"60851545a5da133ac6c38686","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d385fcc513acef80a3b711aa92d898e5.svg","fullname":"Jing Xiong","name":"menik1126","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.05073","authors":[{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf92","user":{"_id":"672fc8ede7c89e44c9757259","avatarUrl":"/avatars/caa0d0de519ea96992c81328c89b3843.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Changdae Oh","user":"changdae","type":"user"},"name":"Changdae Oh","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-06T18:49:48.459Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf93","name":"Seongheon Park","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf94","name":"To Eun Kim","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf95","name":"Jiatong Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf96","name":"Wendi Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf97","name":"Samuel Yeh","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf98","name":"Xuefeng Du","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf99","name":"Hamed Hassani","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf9a","name":"Paul Bogdan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf9b","name":"Dawn Song","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985f52430e925bc620acf9c","name":"Sharon Li","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-04T21:47:40.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-06T11:36:31.174Z","title":"Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"672fc8ede7c89e44c9757259","avatarUrl":"/avatars/caa0d0de519ea96992c81328c89b3843.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Changdae Oh","user":"changdae","type":"user"},"summary":"Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications.

Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.05494.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"65d61e7888196f05410f3aa3","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/65d61e7888196f05410f3aa3/E7COFUfyzVo37aOJ_18pR.jpeg","fullname":"qy","name":"qingyuanwu","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2602.05023","authors":[{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec57","user":{"_id":"629d3e2ce6709241d69cf2b6","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4d213e0c6649a0db63c51eb84fad413a.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ray Yang","user":"RayY","type":"user"},"name":"Ruixin Yang","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-06T18:51:00.492Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec58","user":{"_id":"635d76ce94e5b275ca74b967","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5d9a389e5fd558c0b8f0724bf0838a3e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ethan Mendes","user":"emendes3","type":"user"},"name":"Ethan Mendes","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2026-02-06T18:50:57.628Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec59","name":"Arthur Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec5a","name":"James Hays","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec5b","name":"Sauvik Das","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec5c","name":"Wei Xu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6985735a4ad556f294b7ec5d","name":"Alan Ritter","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2026-02-04T20:24:14.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-06T02:53:34.874Z","title":"Do Vision-Language Models Respect Contextual Integrity in Location Disclosure?","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"629d3e2ce6709241d69cf2b6","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4d213e0c6649a0db63c51eb84fad413a.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Ray Yang","user":"RayY","type":"user"},"summary":"Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs).

Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.22345.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"68a0e04b4fb0c20163c64066","avatarUrl":"/avatars/e12137e46d3965e708d1ecefebf57d20.svg","fullname":"Mahdi JafariRaviz","name":"AghaTizi","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"isUserFollowing":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2602.05551","authors":[{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb3f","name":"Yue Ma","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb40","name":"Zhikai Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb41","name":"Tianhao Ren","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb42","name":"Mingzhe Zheng","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb43","name":"Hongyu Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb44","name":"Jiayi Guo","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb45","name":"Mark Fong","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb46","name":"Yuxuan Xue","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb47","name":"Zixiang Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb48","name":"Konrad Schindler","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb49","name":"Qifeng Chen","hidden":false},{"_id":"69855dcf4ad556f294b7eb4a","name":"Linfeng Zhang","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/wXFz1VBdN3s6BQqs-Tp1F.mp4"],"publishedAt":"2026-02-05T11:15:59.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:05.082Z","title":"FastVMT: Eliminating Redundancy in Video Motion Transfer","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","isPro":true,"fullname":"taesiri","user":"taesiri","type":"user"},"summary":"Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video.

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability.

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability.
