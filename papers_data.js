During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm.

During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm.

RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains.

While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of 9.2 million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems.

While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of 9.2 million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality.

this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings.

All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation.

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow.

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow.

Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding.

Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs.

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution.

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.", "thumbnail": "https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.02437.png", "numComments": 0, "submittedBy": {"_id": "6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg", "fullname": "taesiri", "name": "taesiri", "type": "user", "isPro": true, "isHf": false, "isHfAdmin": false, "isMod": false, "followerCount": 227, "isUserFollowing": false}, "isAuthorParticipating": false}, {"paper": {"id": "2602.03786", "authors": [{"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb574b", "user": {"_id": "68a435cc22fdf7356962ccb9", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/467f4732ade5f47b42433ff354acdeef.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "jianhao ruan", "user": "Aurorra1123", "type": "user"}, "name": "Jianhao Ruan", "status": "claimed_verified", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-02-04T12:28:23.320Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb574c", "name": "Zhihao Xu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb574d", "name": "Yiran Peng", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb574e", "name": "Fashen Ren", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb574f", "name": "Zhaoyang Yu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb5750", "name": "Xinbing Liang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb5751", "name": "Jinyu Xiang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb5752", "name": "Bang Liu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb5753", "name": "Chenglin Wu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb5754", "name": "Yuyu Luo", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6982c1c69084cb4f0ecb5755", "user": {"_id": "65f40e83653c231cbaf7defe", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/afa5ce72324112739e539865c9aee26b.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Jiayi Zhang", "user": "didiforhugface", "type": "user"}, "name": "Jiayi Zhang", "status": "claimed_verified", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-02-04T12:28:20.999Z", "hidden": false}], "publishedAt": "2026-02-03T17:46:16.000Z", "submittedOnDailyAt": "2026-02-04T02:34:02.843Z", "title": "AOrchestra: Automating Sub-Agent Creation for Agentic Orchestration", "submittedOnDailyBy": {"_id": "68a435cc22fdf7356962ccb9", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/467f4732ade5f47b42433ff354acdeef.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "jianhao ruan", "user": "Aurorra1123", "type": "user"}, "summary": "Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation.

this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings.

All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation.

introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications.

Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols.", "thumbnail": "https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.17058.png", "numComments": 2, "submittedBy": {"_id": "68216c63856b96f869d1d116", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/f69026ca75377e6754ab3e317879e35a.svg", "fullname": "Wei Zhou", "name": "weizhoudb", "type": "user", "isPro": false, "isHf": false, "isHfAdmin": false, "isMod": false, "followerCount": 1, "isUserFollowing": false}, "organization": {"_id": "63e5ef7bf2e9a8f22c515654", "name": "SJTU", "fullname": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "avatar": "https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1676013394657-63e5ee22b6a40bf941da0928.png"}, "isAuthorParticipating": true}, {"paper": {"id": "2601.22060", "authors": [{"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f0", "user": {"_id": "67dc162ec8c00778e8689f42", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/67dc162ec8c00778e8689f42/_y_tO6W3ONOkOWbumAFXA.png", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Wenxuan Huang", "user": "Osilly", "type": "user"}, "name": "Wenxuan Huang", "status": "claimed_verified", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-02-03T13:59:37.268Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f1", "user": {"_id": "665d652e0f35c005de892108", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/665d652e0f35c005de892108/OGLbgZekX-3XTBkwS8k86.jpeg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Yu Zeng", "user": "YuZeng260", "type": "user"}, "name": "Yu Zeng", "status": "claimed_verified", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-02-03T10:06:52.098Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f2", "name": "Qiuchen Wang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f3", "name": "Zhen Fang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f4", "name": "Shaosheng Cao", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f5", "name": "Zheng Chu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f6", "name": "Qingyu Yin", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f7", "name": "Shuang Chen", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f8", "name": "Zhenfei Yin", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960f9", "user": {"_id": "64b02ec0e5000ae8a572ced5", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64b02ec0e5000ae8a572ced5/6ifLntBU2ICQK7SW8WxKU.png", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Lin Chen", "user": "Lin-Chen", "type": "user"}, "name": "Lin Chen", "status": "claimed_verified", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-02-03T10:06:49.925Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960fa", "name": "Zehui Chen", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960fb", "name": "Yao Hu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960fc", "name": "Philip Torr", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960fd", "name": "Feng Zhao", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817968ce18b186280960fe", "name": "Wanli Ouyang", "hidden": false}], "mediaUrls": ["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/665d652e0f35c005de892108/Z6521nSrzijudoqDlr1vM.mp4"], "publishedAt": "2026-01-29T17:58:40.000Z", "submittedOnDailyAt": "2026-02-03T02:05:47.568Z", "title": "Vision-DeepResearch: Incentivizing DeepResearch Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models", "submittedOnDailyBy": {"_id": "665d652e0f35c005de892108", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/665d652e0f35c005de892108/OGLbgZekX-3XTBkwS8k86.jpeg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Yu Zeng", "user": "YuZeng260", "type": "user"}, "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks.
