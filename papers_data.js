During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm.

During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation.

To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains.

While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of 9.2 million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems.

While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of 9.2 million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality.

this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings.

All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation.

Experiments on Simpler BRIDGE WidowX and CALVIN ABC-D, as well as real-robot evaluations, show strong generalization and performance gains from RL alignment in success rate, robustness, and long-horizon efficiency.", "mediaUrls": ["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/642694c721d5f027bec07c71/cz33CQXXE3--u2_mmgA5G.png"], "thumbnail": "https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.00919.png", "numComments": 1, "submittedBy": {"_id": "642694c721d5f027bec07c71", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/642694c721d5f027bec07c71/0hZEaZ1kFxx4GEig29X_k.jpeg", "fullname": "Polina Fedotova", "name": "2pd", "type": "user", "isPro": false, "isHf": false, "isHfAdmin": false, "isMod": false, "followerCount": 3, "isUserFollowing": false}, "organization": {"_id": "6973998bee83f4964edef012", "name": "SberRoboticsCenter", "fullname": "Sber Robotics Center", "avatar": "https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/642694c721d5f027bec07c71/LkuEJI3abphK4MFbq8tPf.png"}, "isAuthorParticipating": true}, {"paper": {"id": "2602.02276", "authors": [{"_id": "69817e2cce18b1862809615b", "name": "Kimi Team", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817e2cce18b1862809615c", "name": "Tongtong Bai", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817e2cce18b1862809615d", "name": "Yifan Bai", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817e2cce18b1862809615e", "name": "Yiping Bao", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69817e2cce18b1862809615f", "name": "S.

K2.5 emphasizes the joint optimization of text and vision so that two modalities enhance each other. This includes a series of techniques such as joint text-vision pre-training, zero-vision SFT, and joint text-vision reinforcement learning. Building on this multimodal foundation, K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, a self-directed parallel agent orchestration framework that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into heterogeneous sub-problems and executes them concurrently.

To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of \"dominant\" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance.

To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of \"dominant\" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost.

We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation.

We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite.

Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.", "thumbnail": "https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.04145.png", "numComments": 1, "submittedBy": {"_id": "65e02d89574e5aa0e9ce3efa", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/2ab152a10b21d81fb1defc726b8e951a.svg", "fullname": "Langlin Huang", "name": "shrango", "type": "user", "isPro": false, "isHf": false, "isHfAdmin": false, "isMod": false, "followerCount": 1, "isUserFollowing": false}, "isAuthorParticipating": false}, {"paper": {"id": "2602.02437", "authors": [{"_id": "6981756ace18b18628096056", "name": "Dianyi Wang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b18628096057", "name": "Chaofan Ma", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b18628096058", "name": "Feng Han", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b18628096059", "name": "Size Wu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b1862809605a", "name": "Wei Song", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b1862809605b", "user": {"_id": "654c6845bac6e6e49895a5b5", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/KXQaAxulqr8jNBSpEaYM4.png", "isPro": false, "fullname": "SII-Yibin Wang", "user": "CodeGoat24", "type": "user"}, "name": "Yibin Wang", "status": "claimed_verified", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-02-03T10:07:21.031Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b1862809605c", "name": "Zhixiong Zhang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b1862809605d", "name": "Tianhang Wang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b1862809605e", "name": "Siyuan Wang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b1862809605f", "name": "Zhongyu Wei", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "6981756ace18b18628096060", "name": "Jiaqi Wang", "hidden": false}], "publishedAt": "2026-02-02T18:34:35.000Z", "submittedOnDailyAt": "2026-02-03T02:26:49.217Z", "title": "UniReason 1.0: A Unified Reasoning Framework for World Knowledge Aligned Image Generation and Editing", "submittedOnDailyBy": {"_id": "6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg", "isPro": true, "fullname": "taesiri", "user": "taesiri", "type": "user"}, "summary": "Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps.

this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings.

All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation.

introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.", "upvotes": 136, "discussionId": "6976d5405d41524304c135d9", "ai_summary": "A 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts reasoning model achieves state-of-the-art performance on agentic benchmarks through a unified training framework combining domain-parallel expert training with fusion, along with enhancements for real-world robustness and complex reasoning.", "ai_keywords": ["Mixture-of-Experts", "agentic reasoning", "domain-parallel expert training", "fusion", "asynchronous reinforcement learning", "DORA", "long-tailed generation", "multi-turn interactions", "real-world noise patterns", "test-time scaling", "reasoning depth", "reasoning width", "parallel thinking"], "organization": {"_id": "68b28d79a176a9beb30d2049", "name": "meituan-longcat", "fullname": "LongCat", "avatar": "https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68a2a29ab9d4c5698e02c747/CDCAx7X7rXDt7xjI-DoxG.png"}, "summary_zh": "<ul>\n    <li>\u6211\u4eec\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u67095600\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002</li>\n    <li>\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u81ea\u4e3b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002</li>\n    <li>LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002</li>\n    <li>\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u878d\u5408\u3002</li>\n    <li>\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002</li>\n</ul>", "summary_simple": "<ul>\n    <li>LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 is a 560-billion-parameter open-source reasoning model designed for improved decision-making and problem-solving.</li>\n    <li>It outperforms other open-source models in various tasks, including searching for information and using tools effectively.</li>\n    <li>The model is trained through a special method that helps it adapt well to complex situations and changes in the real world.</li>\n    <li>It uses a new training framework that allows it to learn from more than 10,000 different environments, enhancing its performance in diverse tasks.</li>\n    <li>A Heavy Thinking mode has been added to boost its reasoning skills during tests by allowing it to think more deeply and broadly at the same time.</li>\n</ul>"}, "publishedAt": "2026-01-23T08:20:09.000Z", "title": "LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 Technical Report", "summary": "We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability.

Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\\% to 22.1\\% compared to Gemini-3-Pro with Google Search/Map grounded mode.", "thumbnail": "https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2601.05432.png", "numComments": 3, "submittedBy": {"_id": "66d255e3947594430c723ff6", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/c56e4792332a01bf34085a75ee64916e.svg", "fullname": "xiaochonglinghu", "name": "xiaochonglinghu", "type": "user", "isPro": false, "isHf": false, "isHfAdmin": false, "isMod": false, "followerCount": 6, "isUserFollowing": false}, "organization": {"_id": "64488b334988ee01f2a8d856", "name": "alibaba-inc", "fullname": "alibaba-inc", "avatar": "https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/61ac8f8a00d01045fca0ad2f/MX4wxQVaFm1A1wqnrL2WU.jpeg"}, "isAuthorParticipating": true}, {"paper": {"id": "2601.17058", "authors": [{"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e06", "user": {"_id": "68216c63856b96f869d1d116", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/f69026ca75377e6754ab3e317879e35a.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Wei Zhou", "user": "weizhoudb", "type": "user"}, "name": "Wei Zhou", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:59:49.701Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e07", "name": "Jun Zhou", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e08", "name": "Haoyu Wang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e09", "name": "Zhenghao Li", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e0a", "name": "Qikang He", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e0b", "name": "Shaokun Han", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e0c", "name": "Guoliang Li", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e0d", "user": {"_id": "64ef522242da8d2a897d62da", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/03611010d247da66696ac8976d4d3ed3.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "xuanhe zhou", "user": "zhouxh19", "type": "user"}, "name": "Xuanhe Zhou", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:58:19.930Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e0e", "user": {"_id": "674fa2f067c963c50a066594", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/674fa2f067c963c50a066594/hKZ46Mwm_UEguzBt63ys_.jpeg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "yeye he", "user": "yeyehe", "type": "user"}, "name": "Yeye He", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:58:27.638Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e0f", "name": "Chunwei Liu", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e10", "user": {"_id": "66724ce47e7ff5d8bd069c7c", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/953f66585390dbdb202c1d7b7250d7bd.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Zirui Tang", "user": "TerryTang", "type": "user"}, "name": "Zirui Tang", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:58:49.525Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e11", "name": "Bin Wang", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e12", "user": {"_id": "695612aabf3c8959a3a05f9c", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/c18885f6dea6f3ee019405cd8cf6f484.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "ShenTang990", "user": "shentang", "type": "user"}, "name": "Shen Tang", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:58:56.579Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e13", "name": "Kai Zuo", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e14", "user": {"_id": "67efa8a2ed790a2e999dc216", "avatarUrl": "https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/0S4lQCJX61uCF8EkSLMkk.png", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Yuyu Luo", "user": "luoyuyu", "type": "user"}, "name": "Yuyu Luo", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:59:02.233Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e15", "name": "Zhenzhe Zheng", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e16", "user": {"_id": "63f9fca8d4349b157a109eec", "avatarUrl": "/avatars/fa1f2ae7972d7cde99dab178136ccbb0.svg", "isPro": false, "fullname": "Conghui He", "user": "conghui", "type": "user"}, "name": "Conghui He", "status": "admin_assigned", "statusLastChangedAt": "2026-01-27T13:57:14.525Z", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e17", "name": "Jingren Zhou", "hidden": false}, {"_id": "69782c96026bdf0473116e18", "name": "Fan Wu", "hidden": false}], "publishedAt": "2026-01-22T12:02:45.000Z", "submittedOnDailyAt": "2026-01-27T00:42:38.464Z", "title": "Can LLMs Clean Up Your Mess?
