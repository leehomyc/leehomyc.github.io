Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x.

Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.19773.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"65cae89119683f9817c049ea","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/65cae89119683f9817c049ea/A0XxjmaJldu28JhFvWmpP.jpeg","fullname":"Wenqi Shi","name":"wshi83","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false},"organization":{"_id":"688ec8e2ea39631b70dc34db","name":"eigen-ai-labs","fullname":"Eigen AI","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6514d59cf95f39fd02acd9dc/oELb680wyZPzGhhO-w1pG.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2511.20561","authors":[{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca91","name":"Yuwei Niu","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca92","name":"Weiyang Jin","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca93","name":"Jiaqi Liao","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca94","name":"Chaoran Feng","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca95","name":"Peng Jin","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca96","name":"Bin Lin","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca97","name":"Zongjian Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca98","name":"Bin Zhu","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca99","name":"Weihao Yu","hidden":false},{"_id":"692671a3243b2216fb75ca9a","name":"Li Yuan","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/66608add236f958513d21d2e/LUJu9PnWzLTa49ONkbY5H.png"],"publishedAt":"2025-11-25T17:58:48.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-26T01:19:47.715Z","title":"Does Understanding Inform Generation in Unified Multimodal Models?

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures.

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures.

The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only approx0.419 s per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.18945.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63e5017caf814a2149ec772d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63e5017caf814a2149ec772d/W1Vfd4Na5kTmxeHoChSIB.jpeg","fullname":"German G","name":"grgera","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2511.18024","authors":[{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a40","name":"Dor Arviv","hidden":false},{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a41","user":{"_id":"662a80358a721ebd0b4f358b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5be5a3c8b13f6f663206a19d0525c18e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yehonatan Elisha","user":"Yoniel","type":"user"},"name":"Yehonatan Elisha","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:34:23.580Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a42","name":"Oren Barkan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a43","user":{"_id":"669536cad4ca2767b9a9da91","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/itE8uwV6pji4yR38F3zCP.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Noam Koenigstein","user":"deltalab-noam","type":"user"},"name":"Noam Koenigstein","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:34:43.704Z","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2025-11-22T11:27:32.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-25T05:26:49.924Z","title":"Extracting Interaction-Aware Monosemantic Concepts in Recommender Systems","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"662a80358a721ebd0b4f358b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5be5a3c8b13f6f663206a19d0525c18e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yehonatan Elisha","user":"Yoniel","type":"user"},"summary":"We present a method for extracting monosemantic neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems.

However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback.

However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback.

The best off-the-shelf model (Wan2.2-Flash) achieves only 0.299 overall score, revealing significant limitations in current world models for robotic planning tasks. We show that fine-tuning an open-source 5B-parameter model on only 325 scenarios from our dataset achieves 0.345 overall score -- an improvement of more than 400% over its base version (0.066) and 15% higher than the best off-the-shelf model. We will open-source the code and dataset.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/Cl6TTW-8t_j4VWw0YNaDD.mp4"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.17792.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/6039478ab3ecf716b1a5fd4d/_Thy4E7taiSYBLKxEKJbT.jpeg","fullname":"taesiri","name":"taesiri","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":170},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2511.18050","authors":[{"_id":"692525c216eb3a9f1310396f","name":"Tian Ye","hidden":false},{"_id":"692525c216eb3a9f13103970","name":"Song Fei","hidden":false},{"_id":"692525c216eb3a9f13103971","name":"Lei Zhu","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2025-11-22T13:07:21.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-25T01:29:51.780Z","title":"UltraFlux: Data-Model Co-Design for High-quality Native 4K Text-to-Image Generation across Diverse Aspect Ratios","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"66015e8aa4d296af07de538e","avatarUrl":"/avatars/a1295c631cc2646282c545859975ce4c.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Owen","user":"Owen777","type":"user"},"summary":"Diffusion transformers have recently delivered strong text-to-image generation around 1K resolution, but we show that extending them to native 4K across diverse aspect ratios exposes a tightly coupled failure mode spanning positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization.

In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction.

In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.18423.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"64a38c590111d5ff6c3d5f2b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/ef13dc7ce243819bc0da9b04e778b432.svg","fullname":"zhengliu","name":"lz1001","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":10},"organization":{"_id":"61be9739d2f9358e24ca0a4f","name":"BAAI","fullname":"Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence","avatar":"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1664511063789-632c234f42c386ebd2710434.png"},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2511.15567","authors":[{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482df9","user":{"_id":"64440be5af034cdfd69ca3a7","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64440be5af034cdfd69ca3a7/qmx24QiDFT29vleCxL9TX.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Qinghong (Kevin) Lin","user":"KevinQHLin","type":"user"},"name":"Kevin Qinghong Lin","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:06:05.314Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482dfa","name":"Siyuan Hu","hidden":false},{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482dfb","name":"Linjie Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482dfc","user":{"_id":"630713411801ecc7d2592a7c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/fb36f69f03421c3a2a7f72ba0858fa60.svg","isPro":true,"fullname":"Zhengyuan Yang","user":"zyang39","type":"user"},"name":"Zhengyuan Yang","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:36:56.053Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482dfd","name":"Lijuan Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482dfe","user":{"_id":"6565ed28a5ec0231cb07225f","avatarUrl":"/avatars/7f95bba9aa7811d56eecb380827abfac.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"prof philip torr","user":"philiptorr","type":"user"},"name":"Philip Torr","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:36:50.554Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"692067008c38b39d6a482dff","user":{"_id":"661ab3da2b14565c7acccf5c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/fa4fc03664803e02aede4d4c3d50b393.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Mike Zheng Shou","user":"AnalMom","type":"user"},"name":"Mike Zheng Shou","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:36:42.407Z","hidden":false}],"mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64440be5af034cdfd69ca3a7/46SJDQ6RRkIZYeUC4jmvo.mp4"],"publishedAt":"2025-11-19T16:00:02.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-25T00:11:39.230Z","title":"Computer-Use Agents as Judges for Generative User Interface","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64440be5af034cdfd69ca3a7","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/64440be5af034cdfd69ca3a7/qmx24QiDFT29vleCxL9TX.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Qinghong (Kevin) Lin","user":"KevinQHLin","type":"user"},"summary":"Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).

Experiments demonstrate that I-Mix2Mix significantly improves multi-view consistency while maintaining high per-frame edit quality.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.14899.png","numComments":2,"submittedBy":{"_id":"672b303918685a38713dd8f1","avatarUrl":"/avatars/800802127af17be6370bf7f65b4a0cc9.svg","fullname":"Daniel Gilo","name":"danielgilo","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2511.14806","authors":[{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e4e","user":{"_id":"640f7083208821a59b74c757","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/1678735253848-640f7083208821a59b74c757.jpeg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Siyuan Li","user":"Lupin1998","type":"user"},"name":"Siyuan Li","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-24T12:26:57.695Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e4f","name":"Kai Yu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e50","name":"Anna Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e51","name":"Zicheng Liu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e52","name":"Chang Yu","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e53","name":"Jingbo Zhou","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e54","name":"Qirong Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e55","name":"Yucheng Guo","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e56","name":"Xiaoming Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6920670c8c38b39d6a482e57","name":"Stan Z.
