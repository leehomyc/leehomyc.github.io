We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies.

By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.","mediaUrls":["https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6476ae4083d4fdaedddf405f/axZxaLRAK4_474L0EJ2RM.png","https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6476ae4083d4fdaedddf405f/WcB-LRJRGhSqkkvZKs9Eg.png","https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6476ae4083d4fdaedddf405f/n2MDymrFJkRHzHKyDT3sW.png"],"thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.16660.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"6476ae4083d4fdaedddf405f","avatarUrl":"/avatars/08b23ccfa1f3bede6ade5a1aef06931d.svg","fullname":"Priyanka Kargupta","name":"pkargupta","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2511.20102","authors":[{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb22","user":{"_id":"641b31a4ec5b871c0bcd6932","avatarUrl":"/avatars/bad42279ad99918b0846053f2fa95ac8.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Zhenyi Shen","user":"zen-E","type":"user"},"name":"Zhenyi Shen","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-26T11:31:23.403Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb23","user":{"_id":"64ddbc3f1f2dad27e1a05ac1","avatarUrl":"/avatars/4fb2753b7998c8536bfd4780d3b10a6d.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Junrulu","user":"Junrulu","type":"user"},"name":"Junru Lu","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-26T09:27:16.085Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb24","name":"Lin Gui","hidden":false},{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb25","user":{"_id":"64be88e9af05eb17c702787c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/8953032acd739a0780e33cc46b0f9b56.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"J Li","user":"jiazhengli","type":"user"},"name":"Jiazheng Li","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-26T11:53:51.303Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb26","name":"Yulan He","hidden":false},{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb27","name":"Di Yin","hidden":false},{"_id":"69269351243b2216fb75cb28","name":"Xing Sun","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2025-11-25T09:21:57.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-26T08:37:31.990Z","title":"SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"641b31a4ec5b871c0bcd6932","avatarUrl":"/avatars/bad42279ad99918b0846053f2fa95ac8.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Zhenyi Shen","user":"zen-E","type":"user"},"summary":"The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs).

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin.

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation.

By releasing the full suite of model weights, datasets, and pipelines, we hope to stimulate future research on VQ-VA.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.20573.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"652e9c5774d1b0d7ff73d091","avatarUrl":"/avatars/a6d2098b3dde4a8b7488a193f0ecb776.svg","fullname":"Chenhui Gou","name":"gouc","type":"user","isPro":true,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":3},"isAuthorParticipating":false},{"paper":{"id":"2511.20123","authors":[{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb17","name":"Min Zhao","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb18","user":{"_id":"64c269a52d73768f07ac266c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d497a960f8aef6a974907b68ed750c1c.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Zhu Hongzhou","user":"zhuhz22","type":"user"},"name":"Hongzhou Zhu","status":"claimed_verified","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-26T09:27:18.068Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb19","name":"Yingze Wang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb1a","name":"Bokai Yan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb1b","name":"Jintao Zhang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb1c","name":"Guande He","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb1d","name":"Ling Yang","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb1e","name":"Chongxuan Li","hidden":false},{"_id":"6926928b243b2216fb75cb1f","name":"Jun Zhu","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2025-11-25T09:44:10.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-26T03:16:49.152Z","title":"UltraViCo: Breaking Extrapolation Limits in Video Diffusion Transformers","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"64c269a52d73768f07ac266c","avatarUrl":"/avatars/d497a960f8aef6a974907b68ed750c1c.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Zhu Hongzhou","user":"zhuhz22","type":"user"},"summary":"Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation.

To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis.

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures.

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures.

Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling.

Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling.

Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.","thumbnail":"https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2511.18945.png","numComments":1,"submittedBy":{"_id":"63e5017caf814a2149ec772d","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/63e5017caf814a2149ec772d/W1Vfd4Na5kTmxeHoChSIB.jpeg","fullname":"German G","name":"grgera","type":"user","isPro":false,"isHf":false,"isHfAdmin":false,"isMod":false,"followerCount":2},"isAuthorParticipating":true},{"paper":{"id":"2511.18024","authors":[{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a40","name":"Dor Arviv","hidden":false},{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a41","user":{"_id":"662a80358a721ebd0b4f358b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5be5a3c8b13f6f663206a19d0525c18e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yehonatan Elisha","user":"Yoniel","type":"user"},"name":"Yehonatan Elisha","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:34:23.580Z","hidden":false},{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a42","name":"Oren Barkan","hidden":false},{"_id":"6925312216eb3a9f13103a43","user":{"_id":"669536cad4ca2767b9a9da91","avatarUrl":"https://cdn-avatars.huggingface.co/v1/production/uploads/no-auth/itE8uwV6pji4yR38F3zCP.png","isPro":false,"fullname":"Noam Koenigstein","user":"deltalab-noam","type":"user"},"name":"Noam Koenigstein","status":"admin_assigned","statusLastChangedAt":"2025-11-25T09:34:43.704Z","hidden":false}],"publishedAt":"2025-11-22T11:27:32.000Z","submittedOnDailyAt":"2025-11-25T05:26:49.924Z","title":"Extracting Interaction-Aware Monosemantic Concepts in Recommender Systems","submittedOnDailyBy":{"_id":"662a80358a721ebd0b4f358b","avatarUrl":"/avatars/5be5a3c8b13f6f663206a19d0525c18e.svg","isPro":false,"fullname":"Yehonatan Elisha","user":"Yoniel","type":"user"},"summary":"We present a method for extracting monosemantic neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems.

However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback.

However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback.

We introduce Target-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate world models on mapless path planning toward semantic targets in real-world environments. Target-Bench provides 450 robot-collected video sequences spanning 45 semantic categories with SLAM-based ground truth trajectories. Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series.

We introduce Target-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate world models on mapless path planning toward semantic targets in real-world environments. Target-Bench provides 450 robot-collected video sequences spanning 45 semantic categories with SLAM-based ground truth trajectories. Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series.
